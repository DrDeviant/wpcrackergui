# WPCracker with GUI [ PROJECT ]
Performs multiple brute force and username enumerations tasks in same time.
This is a continuation of the [WPCracker](https://github.com/JoniRinta-Kahila/WPCracker) project.

The frontend has been implemented with [Electron-React-TypeScript-Webpack-Boilerplate](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate).
This boilerplate currently works on macOS and Windows. If something doesn't 
work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/Devtography/electron-react-typescript-webpack-boilerplate/issues/new).
